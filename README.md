# Prediction of Efficiency in Manufacturing

## **Deep Learning-based Production Forecasting in Manufacturing: A Packaging Equipment Case Study**  

### **Overview**  
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-based production forecasting model for manufacturing. The case study focuses on packaging equipment, leveraging synthetic data to evaluate forecasting performance.  

Two models were used for comparison:  

- **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)** â€“ The primary deep learning model.  
- **AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)** â€“ Used as a baseline model.  

Key performance metrics, **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)** and **Mean Model Error (MME)**, were computed using Python to assess the model's forecasting accuracy.
